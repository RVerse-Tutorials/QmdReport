<!-- Use format="pandoc" if you are going to Word. knitr often gets confused if you don't and you'll drive yourself crazy wondering why the same kable() command doesn't show the same table in Word (hint, its because unbeknownst to you, the format argument value on you). -->

```{r}
kable(dt, align="lcc", caption="This is a basic table with an unnumbered caption.", digits=c(0,1,2), format="pandoc")
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-tbl1
#| tbl-cap: "This is a table with a number. Getting the auto-numbering to work is different with Quarto. See the code."
kable(dt, align="lcc", digits=c(0,1,2), format="pandoc")
```
