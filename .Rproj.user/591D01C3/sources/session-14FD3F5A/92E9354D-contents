<!-- Since the main file (index) had this, I don't need to repeat it. 
     But I do so that I can run this Rmd independently during debugging and development.
     I set all the output to FALSE. -->
     
```{r include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)
library(knitr)
library(dplyr) # need this for %>% function
library(flextable)
ishtml <- knitr::is_html_output()
ispdf <- knitr::is_latex_output()
isword <- !ishtml & !ispdf
```

<!-- Specify the data here at top so it is easy to find.
     A better way to do this is to use parameterized Rmd. -->
     
<!-- I am adding the last commit date as the data date.
     That helps makes sure we all know what data were used. -->

```{r}
nYr <- 2000:2010
```

```{r results='asis'}
# So that I can later have many cvsfiles
cvsfiles <- dir(here::here("data"), pattern = "\\.csv")
cvsn <- 1
app.letter <- LETTERS[cvsn]
cvsfile.to.use <- cvsfiles[cvsn]
