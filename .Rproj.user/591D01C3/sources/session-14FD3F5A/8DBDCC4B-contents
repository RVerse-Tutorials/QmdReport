# Kable vs Flex vs qt {#kableflexgt}

Here I compare a three different ways to make tables.

```{r}
tbl_cap <- "Donec bibendum pharetra arcu vitae porttitor. Morbi ac quam nunc. Ut cursus dolor a mauris aliquet vulputate. Morbi elementum ullamcorper augue, et tincidunt libero facilisis posuere. Nam congue velit non elit sollicitudin aliquet."
dt <- (mtcars[1:10,])
f1 <- "Here is a footnote about this table"
f2 <- "Here is a second footnote."
```


## `kable`

Here is the {kable} table @tbl-kable. {kabel} is part of {knitr} so definitely going to be supported by Quarto since Quarto uses the {knitr} engine. Cross-referencing works across HTML, PDF and Word but output to Word is not always great.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-kable
#| tbl-cap: !expr paste("kable:", tbl_cap)
#| echo: true
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
# note hold_position not working in Quarto v1.0.38.
kbl(dt, booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("scale_down")) %>%
  kableExtra::footnote(symbol = c(f1, f2))
```

### `kable` quirks

* Make sure to put `always_allow_html: true` in the yaml at the top of your Rmd or qmd file if outputting to Word. I can't figure out how to put it in the `
* Word output is often not good looking. This is a known issue with `kable`
* Do not pass in caption to `kbl()` if you want to use Quarto's cross-reference engine.
* `kbl(..., format="pandoc")` can help for Word if your templates stop working but destroys the PDF output.

## `flextable`

Here is the {flextable} table @tbl-flex.  {flextable} gives you a lot more control over your tables with a grammar format (like ggplot2). It also gives nice output to Word, PDF and HTML. Sadly in Quarto v1.0.38 cross-reference and table captioning for Word and PDF is completely broken, but the developers know about this. The {officer} package, which I think Quarto is leaning on for Word generation, use {flextable} so I am hoping that {flextable} gets moved into the RStudio suite.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-flex
#| tbl-cap: !expr paste("flextable:", tbl_cap)
#| echo: true
library(flextable)
dt %>%
  flextable() %>%
  autofit() %>%
  flextable::footnote(i = 1, j = 1:2,
            value = as_paragraph(c(f1, f2)),
            ref_symbols = c("a", "b"),
            part = "header") %>%
  font(fontname="Times New Roman", part="all") %>%
  fontsize(size=12)
```

### `flextable` quirks

* Cross-refs broken in Word and PDF. Known issue.

## `gt`

Here is the {gt} table @tbl-gt. {gt} has many of the same features as {flextable} and is in the RStudio suite so maybe it'll get more Quarto support in the long run.
But like {kable}, the Word output is not so great, at least not by default. 

```{r}
#| label: tbl-gt
#| tbl-cap: !expr paste("gt:", tbl_cap)
#| echo: true
library(gt)
dt %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_source_note(source_note = f1) %>%
  tab_source_note(source_note = f2) %>%
  tab_options(
      table.font.size = px(18), 
      table.font.names = "Times New Roman",
      data_row.padding = px(1))
```

### `qt` quirks

* Table captions broken in PDF. Known issue. The "Table X." part is missing.
* I couldn't get {gt} to respect my font request for HTML unlike for {flextable}
